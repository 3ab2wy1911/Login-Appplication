## Idea of the Program
* It's a simple program which simulates the login process like in other applictions and sites but in a simple way.
* The program allows you to :
  * Register new member.
  * Login to your account.
  * Change the old password into a new one.
* As I said, the program is so simple and it's just a simulation of the login process.
